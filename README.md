# Data structures in C++
Repository contains simple code snipptes for data structures implemented in C++.  
This can extend to classical algorithms in the future.  
## Compiling
Implementation uses C++20 features, so you might want compile with ```/std:c++latest``` (msvc) or ```-std=c++2a``` (gcc ^10.1).
