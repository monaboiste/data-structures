# Data structures in C++
Repository contains simple code snipptes for data structures implemented in C++, based off stl's containers. These were coded with understanding stl's insides in mind.  
This can extend to classical algorithms in the future.  

## Compiling
Implementation uses C++20 features, so you might want compile with ```/std:c++latest``` (msvc) or ```-std=c++2a``` (gcc ^10.1).  
##

#### Things to straighten up:
- make more readable interfaces for classes implementation
- reduce amount of allocations in DynamicArray Class (construct in allocated storage)
